Godot has Autoload and C# has singleton pattern, and they're mostly the same with slightly different setup. Autoloads are straightforward if coding in GDScript, but in C#, there's *more than* one way to form a singleton in different situations to meet different requirements.

I'll try to cover them from the more basic ones to more Godot-specific ones. Also, this article is not about *whether* to use singletons, because I don't know, either.

## Level 1: Pure C# Singleton

Pure singleton is useful when it does not utilize the node system that Godot provides, like those related to the save data. Tutorials of this can be found everywhere, so I'm only putting the basic one here.

```csharp
public class Singleton {
  private static Singleton? _instance = null;

  public static Singleton Instance {
    get {
      _instance ??= new();
      return _instance;
    }
  };
}
```

## Level 2: C# Script Extending from a Node

This case is usually when you:

- decide to stick to `[Signal]` for the global event bus in favor of `static event`, or
- want to utilize the hooks that Godot provides, usually `_Input()`.

It can be done by:

```csharp
// res://autoloads/Singleton.cs
public partial class Singleton : Node { // Usually Node is the type
  public static Singleton Instance { get; private set; }

  // Cannot be private, otherwise Godot would complain
  public Singleton() {
    if (Instance is null) {
      Instance = this;
      // Initialization goes here...
    }
    else {
      QueueFree(); // Ensure the node is unique
    }
  }
}
```

...and then directly add the script under the *Globals - Autoload* tag in *Project Settings*. It's not necessary to attach the script to a scene.

If you've enabled nullability check (a.k.a. nullable reference type, or `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`) in your project, [`CS8618`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/nullable-warnings#nonnullable-reference-not-initialized) will be reported on `Instance`, complaining it's not initialized since the compiler has no way to know the singleton *will* be initialized by Godot. There is not much you can do other than silencing the warning.

## Level 3: C# Script Attaching to a Simple Scene

By "simple scene", I mean a scene that does not have any child nodes (it's okay to have resources as its property), or one does not interact with its child node during its initialization. The point is that the initialization of those scenes doesn't need to be postponed to `_Ready()`. It is some kind of variation of the previous case with the difference where you want to set some value for the singleton via the editor, which requires a scene.

The setup for the **previous** case (script extending from a node) can again be used here. The difference comes within the *Project Settings*: the **scene** instead of the script is to be added to *Autoload*.

## Level 4: A Scene with Initialization Involving Child Nodes

At this point, the initialization related to child nodes needs to be done *after* the `_Ready()` hook. To cope with this, the setup needs to be changed:

```csharp
public partial class Singleton : Node { // Or whatever the node type is
  public static Singleton Instance { get; private set; }

  private static bool _initialized = false;

  public Singleton() {
    if (Instance is null) {
      Instance = this;
      // Initialization unrelated to child nodes goes here...
    }
    else {
      QueueFree();
    }
  }

  public override void _Ready() {
    if (!_initilaized) {
      _initilaized = true;
      // Initialization related to child nodes needs to go here...
    }
  }
}
```

A significant difference (and *pitfall*) here is about *when* the things related to the child nodes are ready for use, as those things can only be accessed when the singleton is `_Ready()`. For example, if the singleton has something like:

```csharp
public partial class Singleton : Node {
  // Other code...

  [Export]
  public Sprite2D MySprite { get; private set; } // Set via the editor
}
```

Then, due to the order of node instantiation, `MySprite` is only available when the `Singleton` is `_Ready()`, before which it will be **`null`**. In my codebase I'll have something like:

```csharp
public partial class AnotherNode : Node {
  private Sprite2D? _sprite;

  // The constructor of AnotherNode might be called
  // before the Singleton is ready
  public AnotherNode() {
    Singleton.Instance.OnReady(() => {
      _sprite = Singleton.Instance.MySprite
    });
  }
}
```

Here, `OnReady` is a custom extension method to delay the code execution (in its `Action` parameter) until the the node is ready. ~~Well, I just want to show off my over-sugared Godot C# utilities without exposing the underlying code.~~

To make it clear, things that are not related to the child nodes (e.g., `[Signal]`s and resources at the root node) are still available as soon as possible via `Instance`, and the only thing matters might be the order in *Autoload*.
